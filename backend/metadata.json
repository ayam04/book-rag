And we might add: \nHigher Order Cognition is the mental capacity to acquire, construct, and \nevaluate what is transmitted as \u2018knowledge\u2019 in schools and colleges.    \nWhat does all this mean? For an experiential understanding of these \ngoals described above, you need to work through at least the first three \nchapters of the book. In the meantime, we will try to give you a broad \nidea of what this book aims at, by giving a few examples, and pointing to \nsome of the broad strategies that the book uses to achieve its goals.   \nWhat we Expect you will Learn   \nYou may find this book very different from all the textbooks you are \nfamiliar with. There are at least two reasons for this.  \n1. The focus here is not on \u2018information\u2019 and \u2018knowledge\u2019. This material \nwill not help you get the specific knowledge content of any particular \nsubject. The aim is for you to develop the general abilities you need \nfor inquiring and thinking critically.  \n \nSo instead of teaching you the proof of, say, the Pythagoras theorem, \nwe will look at how to prove something, whether in math, the sciences, \nor the humanities. Rather than learning the correlation between \ntemperature and pressure in a body of gas \u2014 that the pressure of a \nbody of gas increases as its temperature increases; or the causes of \nworld wars, you will learn how to see correlations between variables, \nand to find out how something causes something else. You will also \nlearn to think critically about the statements in textbooks, and figure \nout whether or not you should accept them.  \n2. What you would learn, including the abilities mentioned in (1), are \nrelevant for all subjects and subject groups: it does not belong to any \nparticular subject or \u2018discipline\u2019 or to any subject group. We call this \nkind of learning trans-disciplinary. As we proceed, you will begin to \nsee what that means. \nIf you are curious to know more about the book"

This will help you read the entire \nbook with a better sense of direction. \nThe Framework for Learning and Teaching \nLearning in a course that this book is meant for is student-driven. It is \ndesigned in a way that students who can read and understand English \ncan engage with the concepts in the book, work through the exercises \nboth individually and in groups, and acquire the necessary abilities on \ntheir own, even if there is no classroom or teacher to help them.  \nOne feature of the course needs special mention, namely, the idea of a \n\u2018flipped classroom\u2019. In most courses in schools and colleges, teachers are \nmediators between the learners and the learning materials such as \ntextbooks and worksheets. Teachers draw upon the textbooks to help \nstudents understand the concepts, and the exercises in the worksheets \nfor practice. After a class session, learners turn to the materials to \nconsolidate what they have learned:  \n \nA \u2018flipped classroom\u2019 inverts or \u2018flips\u2019 this sequence, to enable \nindependent learning. Learners engage with the materials directly, and \nlearn from them without the teacher\u2019s help.  \nWhat, then, is the role of experienced instructors \u2014 facilitators of \nlearning \u2014 in this model of education? They provide value-added help \nwhich begins after students have engaged directly with the materials. The \nteacher would respond to clarificatory and exploratory questions from \nstudents, and provide further guidance by asking questions, setting more \nexercises, and getting students more engaged.  \nIn this mode, the time that students and teachers spend together in the \nclass would be used for such activities, which add value to the course. \n \nWe invite you to embark on this learning adventure that gives you space \nto be curious, to learn how to learn, and become an independent learner, \ninquirer, and critical thinker. \n"

It recommends that education should develop \nhigher-order cognitive abilities. What does that mean?   \nSamira: Yes, I too read that report. \u2018Higher-order cognitive skills,\u2019 eh? I \nthink we need to unpack this systematically.  \n        \nFirst, let's find out what cognition means. That will help us figure \nout what cognitive abilities are. Then, we can look for what is \nspecial about higher-order cognitive abilities.   \nRafa: \nOkay, so what is cognition?  \nSamira: If I were not at home today, what would you do to find out?  \nRafa: \nHmm\u2026I don\u2019t know.  \nSamira: Would you ask someone who knows, or look up the word \ncognition on the Internet, or try to find out by thinking through, \nor try a combination of these?  \nRafa: \nSo you\u2019re not going to tell me. Okay, maybe I\u2019ll do an Internet \nsearch. \nSamira: We\u2019ll talk again after you\u2019ve done your search, then.  \nRafa found two entries for cognition on the Internet:  \n \n\u201c\u2026 the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and \nunderstanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\u201d \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) \n \n \u201c\u2026 the states and processes involved in knowing, which in their \ncompleteness include perception and judgment. Cognition includes all \nconscious and unconscious processes by which knowledge is accumulated, \nsuch as perceiving, recognizing, conceiving, and reasoning.\u201d  \n \n(https://www.britannica.com/topic/cognition-thought-process) \nSo the Wikipedia entry described cognition as a mental action or process, \nwhile the Britannica entry described it as a combination of states and \nprocesses. \nAs he read, Rafa made a note: To cognize is to know.  \nAfter some reflection, Rafa felt that he understood what cognition means, \nthough he was not very confident.  \nOn the Internet, Rafa also found that some websites described Higher-\nOrder Cognition (HOC), as the ability to engage with challenging \nproblems. But they didn\u2019t explain what counts as a challenging problem. \n"

Intelligence seems to be the capacity to do \nthings with our minds. \nSamira: And is that a capacity that people are born with? Or is it \nsomething that you can develop through effort? \nRafa: \nHm! I think we can develop it, just like our physical capacity.

They took several hours to come up \nwith a plan. Once they had agreed on it, Rafa and Samira cycled back \nhome, with thoughts of the delicious poori and aamras lunch waiting for \nthem. \n2.2 Inquiry through Reflection    \nOn the way, a thought suddenly struck Rafa. Riding his bicycle, Rafa \nimagined the earth as a ball \u2014 a perfectly smooth sphere, without \nmountains, rivers, or oceans. He could keep riding without any \nobstruction, without changing his direction. What would happen if he \nkept on riding, without stopping? \nThe answer that emerged in his mind surprised him: he would return to \nwhere he had started. Whichever direction he was riding in, as long as \nhe didn\u2019t change direction, he would come back to his starting point.  \nNow another thought struck him. He said to himself: \u201cA straight line is a \npath that does not change its direction.\u201d But a path of what?  \nHe imagined himself as a point.  \n \nA straight line is the path traced by a moving point that \ndoes not change its direction. \nWas that a definition of a straight line? Yes. And a pretty good one too!  \nHe was beginning to feel excited. The bicycle path that he was thinking \nof was a straight line. Given the size of the earth, a bicycle is so small \nthat it can be thought of as a point.  \nHe went back to thinking about his earlier conclusion: if he were riding \nhis bicycle on a smooth spherical earth in a straight path, he would \nreturn to the point from which he started the ride. Now, if he was a \npoint, then given his definition, he could conclude that:  \nEvery straight line, extended on a spherical surface, would meet itself.  \nWould that be the case on a flat surface? No.  \nNo straight line on a flat surface, even when extended infinitely, , \nwould meet itself.  \nNow yet another thought occurred to him. His teacher had told him that \nthe geometry that he was learning in school was called Euclidean \ngeometry. This was a flat surface geometry. But there was another \ngeometry called spherical geometry. Rafa didn\u2019t know much about \nspherical geometry, except that"

Simply by focusing on specific elements of a question, \nimagining, and thinking carefully, he had discovered an important way in \nwhich spherical geometry and flat geometry were different from each \nother.  \nSamira\u2019s voice from inside the home broke into his thoughts. He came \nawake from the world of geometry. He couldn\u2019t wait to tell his mother \nabout his discovery. He opened the gate, jumped off his bicycle, and \nwithout bothering to put it on a stand, ran towards Samira, \u201cMom, this \nis really cool stuff.

Can you tell me what your main propositions are? \nLet\u2019s write them down. \nRafa: \nHuh? What are propositions? \nSamira: A proposition is what a sentence asserts. In simpler words, a \nproposition is what we mean by a sentence. Let me give you an \nexample. Suppose I wrote down four sentences: \n \n \n(i) Point A comes before point B. \n \n \n(ii) Point A precedes point B. \n \n \n(iii) Point B comes after point A. \n \n \n(iv) Point B follows point A. \n \nDon\u2019t these sentences all mean the same thing? \nRafa: \nOf course they do. \nSamira: So we have four different sentences, but they all express the \nsame proposition. They say the same thing. Now look at the \nopposite case. Imagine this sentence in a story: \n \n \n(v) Anu is reading the book on the windowsill. \n \nWhat does the sentence mean? \n"

Problems have to do with either a gap in something that \ncurrently exists and is desirable, or something that is undesirable in the \ncurrent state of affairs. For instance, a world without suffering, poverty, \nhatred, and violence is desirable, but as the world exists today, it is full \nof suffering, poverty, hatred, and violence. The gap between the two is a \nproblem that we need to look for solutions to. Our lack of understanding \nof the Corona virus is undesirable: that is another problem that we \nmust look for solutions to.  \nWhether we view them as questions or problems, it is important to \nappreciate the difference between the questions and problems for \ninquiry or research, and those in traditional examination questions. A \ntraditional examination question is one for which the examiner expects \nstudents to already have a correct answer. For instance, given the \nquestion, \u201cWhat is the tilt of the earth?\u201d the student is expected to \naccess the correct answer already stored in memory, and respond with \n\u201c23.5 degrees\u201d in less than a minute.  \nInquiry questions don\u2019t have such ready answers. When facilitators ask \nan inquiry question, they expect the novice inquirers to not know the \nanswer, but to look for AN answer (not THE answer), arrive at a \nconclusion, and rationally justify the conclusion.

We said \nearlier that some inquiry questions can become research questions at an \nadvanced level. What is the relation between inquiry and research? \nHow are they similar, and how are they different?  \nResearch can be viewed as inquiry that aims to make a contribution to the \nexisting pool of collective knowledge. So, both school students and PhD \nstudents can engage in inquiry, and both begin their investigation with \na question that they do not have an answer to.

Academic Cognition is the \ncognition relevant for the acquiring, constructing, critically evaluating, \nand applying academic knowledge. We use the terms Academic \nCognition and Higher Order Cognition to mean the same thing.  \nAnd we also said that Academic Knowledge (AK) is the body of \nknowledge constructed and validated by an academic community, and \ntransmitted through educational institutions (i.e., schools, colleges, \nuniversities, institutes) and research publications.  \nImplicit in that characterisation of AK is that it is the result of the \nAcademic Research of an Academic Community. What makes the \nresearch of that community worthy of being called Academic Research? \nWhat makes the result of that research worthy of being called Academic \nKnowledge? Who is an academic? What makes something academic?  \nIt boils down to the question, \u201cWhat is Academia?\u201d According to the \nOxford Learner\u2019s Dictionaries, academia is \"the world of learning, \nteaching, research, etc. at universities, and the people involved in it.\" \n(https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/academia) \nA prototypical body of academic knowledge has the following traits:  \n A. Rationality: \nAcademic knowledge is a form of rational knowledge, \nin which conclusions are rationally justified. The central pillars \nof rationality are (a) acceptance of the logical consequences \n(conclusions) of the propositions that we have accepted, and (b) \nrejection of the combination of propositions that result in a \nlogical contradiction.  \n B. Proving: \nA proof is a rational argument in support of a \nknowledge claim, that is, a proposition that is claimed to be \npart of knowledge. A rational argument is composed of \npremises, steps of derivation, and a conclusion, where the \nconclusion is what is claimed.  \n  \n \n[We must note that the term \u2018proof\u2019 is typically associated with \nmathematical proofs. Here, we have generalised that concept to \ninclude other kinds of proof: those presented in a law court \n(e.g., the prosecution\u2019s argument to prove that the accused is \nguilty), experimental proofs (e.g., proving that smoking causes \ncancer), and so on.

Doubting and Questioning:  Given (C), academia has a commitment \nto doubting and questioning what is taken to be academic \nknowledge. In the context of academic institutions, this means \nthat learners have a responsibility to doubt and question what \nthey regard as knowledge, and what is transmitted to them as \nknowledge by their teachers, textbooks, and published \nresearch, by asking and engaging with the question, \u201cHow do \nyou know that?\u201d and \u201cWhy should I accept that as \u2018knowledge\u2019?\u201d \n E.

What Makes Something Trans-disciplinary?   \nA discipline-specific concept, proposition, or form of inquiry is restricted \nto the given discipline. In contrast, a trans-disciplinary concept, \nproposition, or form of inquiry does not belong to any given discipline: it \nexists above the level of disciplines, across disciplinary boundaries.  \nConsider the concept of structure. The structure of atoms comes under \nphysics, the structure of molecules comes under chemistry, the \nstructure of a skeleton comes under biology, the structure of a sentence \ncomes under linguistics, the structure of a poem comes under literary \nstudies, and the structure of an organisation comes under \norganisational studies. But the concept of structure itself is not \nbounded by any one discipline.  \nWe see the world around us in terms of the ideas of ENTITIES, their \nPROPERTIES (traits and trait values; variables and values,\u2026), the \nRELATIONS among them, and the STATES, PROCESSES, and EVENTS they \nparticipate in. The transdisciplinary concepts of STRUCTURE, CHANGE, and \nCAUSE are closely tied up with all these ideas. \nSTRUCTURE would involve COMPOSITIONALITY, along with UNITS, and \nCATEGORIES, as well as DIMENSIONS and LEVELS of structure.

The removal of weeds is called weeding. \nWeeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, \nnutrients, space and light. Thus, they affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds \ninterfere even in harvesting and may be poisonous for animals and human beings.\u201d \n(Source: NCERT Grade 8 Science Textbook, Chapter 1, pg. 10) \nhttps://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?hesc1=1-13 \nPassage 2: \n\u201cWeeds can be a problem for many gardeners, with valid reasoning: They do \ncompete with our chosen plants for nutrients, water, and space. However, the \nwiser amongst us know that weeds are not only useful but also often play a \nsystemically vital role. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that we necessarily want them popping \nup all over our cultivated beds \u2014 a good dose of mulch and establishing ground \ncovers can help with that \u2014 yet, with a step back, a sense of humor, and solution-\noriented thinking, we may find ourselves appreciating rather than antagonizing \nweeds. At this point, they become less pest and more partner. \nNot to mislead, working wisely with weeds will not mean that a gardener will never \nagain find himself or herself hunched over a bed in horror, trying to get them by \nthe roots, but once again, as permaculture encourages us, working with nature as \nopposed to against it will provide better results for both humans and the \nenvironment. \u201cWeeds\u201d the word may be a human construct, but the plants \nthemselves are natural and have functional niches within the formation of \necosystems, not to mention a multitude of oft overlooked uses within our \ncultivation.

CONCLUSION \n4 Valid and Invalid Derivations  \n4.1 \nWhen Premises are Missing \nSuppose we are told that the following premises are true: \n \n1.  Athena is taller than Apollo. \n(P1) \n \n2. Apollo is taller than Zeno. \n(P2)  \n \n \n \n \n3.  Plato is taller than Socrates. \n(P4) \n \n \n4. Socrates is taller than Aristotle. (P5) \nWe are again asked: Who is taller, Athena or Aristotle?  \nAre we in a position to answer the question? No. Premises 1, 2, 3 and 4 \nallow us to infer that Athena is taller than Zeno, and that Plato is taller \nthan Aristotle. But there is no premise that connects Athena and \nAristotle even indirectly. That is, one of the crucial premises needed for \nderiving an answer is missing in the set of given premises, and hence, we \ncannot answer the question. Suppose we add that missing premise: \n \n P3.  Zeno is taller than Plato. \nwe would now be able to infer that Athena is taller than Aristotle. \nWe will use the terms  \nVALID to refer to a derivation that is without flaws, and  \nINVALID to refer to a derivation that is flawed.  \nThe derivation of the conclusion that Athena is taller than Aristotle is \nvalid given the premises in 1-5. But it is invalid if any one of those \npremises is missing.    \nLet us take a few more examples to get a feel for what we mean by \nvalidity of derivations. In doing this, we will consider several premise-\nconclusion sets (PC), without necessarily spelling out the steps of the \nderivation. We will also take it that if the derivation is valid, then the \nconclusion is legitimate.  \nConsider the following example of a premise-conclusion set (PC1): \nPC1: P1 The base of this rectangle is 12 cms. \n \nC \nTherefore, its area is 120 sq. cms. \n"

Consider \nPC4: \nPC4: P1 Apollo and Athena are siblings. \n \nP2 Athena and Aphrodite are siblings. \n \nP3 Aphrodite and Hermes are siblings.  \n \nC \nApollo and Hermes are siblings. \nIn PC4, we can intuitively arrive at the conclusion from the premises, \nbecause we know the meaning of the word sibling. We say that in PC4, C \nfollows from P1, P2 and P3.

The reason \nthat Omega gives is that this is the best way to get very high scores in \nthe exams. And Alpha asks why it is the best way to get high scores.  \nWhat reasons would you give, if you were in Omega\u2019s position? Stop \nreading for a little while, take a walk, think about your answer, and \nthen come back to the conversation.  \nA: I don\u2019t think this is a good strategy to get high scores. Do you think \nthey ask you questions from all the textbooks from Class 8 to Class \n10 in the board exams?  \nO: Of course. Examiners pick randomly from all the textbooks. You \ncan\u2019t tell what they are going to ask, so you have to memorise \neverything and practice all the exercises.  \nA: Have you actually looked at the exam papers from the past five to \nten years?

When you have an \nanswer, formulate it, and write it down. If possible, discuss this \nquestion with your friends, and come up with a joint answer.  \nLet us go to an extended example. This one is from math.  \nIf someone were to ask: What is the area of a triangle? \nOur answer would be: \nIts base multiplied by its height divided by two.  \nThe inquirer now asks: Why do you think this statement is true?  \nOur response would be to treat the answer as a KNOWLEDGE CLAIM \u2014 a \nstatement that we claim to be true \u2014 and give reasons to support the \nclaim. It might go like this, in the form of a proof. \n[Study the Proof, given on the next page, before you continue.] \nAt this point, a sceptical inquirer might ask:  \n \nWhy should we accept P1 as true? Why should we accept P2 as true? \nWe can answer these questions by taking P1 and P2 as knowledge \nclaims, and giving proofs for them ( = reasons in their support). We \ninvite you to give these proofs, along the lines in the Proof.  \nWhat we have shown is that the claim is true for any triangle that can \nbe created by drawing a diagonal in a rectangle. But can every triangle \nbe created by this procedure? So, we must ask if P1+P2 is sufficient to \nshow that the claim is true for any triangle.   \n3.2 The Role of Experience \nLet us look at another basis for judging the truth of premises. Consider \nthe following scenario: \nAlpha and Sheena are having a conversation about Padu and Cary. \nSheena has not met them. Alpha asserts that Cary is taller than Padu. \nAnd Sheena asks for reasons for that assertion.  \nA: Well, Cary is taller than Zena, and Zena is taller than Padu. So \nCary has to be taller than Padu.  \nS: What is your reason for asserting that Cary is taller than Zena? \nAnd for asserting that Zena is taller than Padu? \nA: I have seen Cary and Zena standing next to each other. And I \nobserved that Cary is taller than Zena. I\u2019ve also seen Zena and \nPadu standing"

An \nunderstanding of the TERMINOLOGY of an academic field is a \nprerequisite to understanding that field.  \nSome domains of academic knowledge, such as mathematics, computer. \nscience, formal logic, and the physical sciences also create specialized \nalgebraic and diagrammatic notations for concepts and propositions to \nencode the knowledge of the field.

The most common mode of communication among \nhumans is that of natural languages like English, Hindi, Malayalam, \nJapanese, Arabic, Russian, Spanish, and so on. \nWe also pointed out that the words in our everyday use of natural \nlanguages tends to be unclear and ambiguous. That property is \nundesirable for the communication of academic knowledge, especially \nfor academic arguments. The terminology of academic knowledge and \nacademic inquiry calls for a high degree of conceptual clarification, \noften in terms of clear and precise definitions.   \nTo minimise ambiguity and imprecision, many forms of academic \ncommunication use algebraic symbols like the following:  \n \nX and Y for variables  \n \n= for equality  \n \n+ for addition \n \n\u2013 for subtraction,  \n \nand so on.   \nIn this chapter, we used the following symbols:  \n \n!  for implication            \n \n\u22a2 for entailment, and  \n \n \n for causation.  \nWe may also use  \n \nfor bidirectional implication (if and only if). \nThese are special symbols for the terminology of logic. In addition to \nthese symbols, we need special symbols for the concepts expressed by \nthe words no and not (negation), and those expressed by all, any, every, \nand so on. Academic communication also uses diagrams such as Venn \nDiagrams, tree diagrams, input-output diagrams, network diagrams, \nflow charts, and so on.  \nWhile linguistics studies natural languages, the study of all systems of \ncommunication covering not only natural languages but also algebraic \nsymbol systems, and diagrammatic notation is called semiotics. \n \n \n"

We have seen an example each from biology and geometry. \nTry to think of examples of classification from other subjects you study. \n3 Subclassifying \n \nFrom a young age, one of the ways we understand the world is by \ngrouping things together into classes based on their properties. For \nexample, young children label toys like building blocks by colour (using \nwords like red, blue, green, yellow), or by shape (round, square, triangle). \nWords in all languages express classes: river, star, planet, animal, \nvertebrate, insect, plant, flower, boy, girl, and country signal the way we \ngroup what we see in nature. Words like table, chair, house, book, and \npoem indicate our classification of man-made entities. As Neel points \nout, classification is also a fundamental tool employed by every \nacademic disciplines. While a category is a set of entities, not all sets are \ncategories. If we put a pencil, a spoon, a rose, a button, and a towel in a \nbasket, we have a set of things in the basket, but they don\u2019t form a \ncategory. \nNow, classification is the same as categorisation.

We take \u2018triangle\u2019 to be a category. \nLook at the shapes in Fig. 5 below. When we say \u2018triangle\u2019, we are not \nreferring to a particular triangle as in A, but to a class that includes A, \nB, C, and D, and excludes E and F: \n \n Figure 5 \nSimilarly, the words cat and dog refer not to a particular cat or a \nparticular dog. Each word refers to a population of living creatures with \ncertain shared characteristics. Members of the category \u2018spider\u2019 share \nthe property of having eight legs. This distinguishes them from members \nof other categories: \u2018bee\u2019 (six legs), \u2018cat\u2019 (four legs), \u2018crow\u2019 (two legs), and \n\u2018snake\u2019 (no legs). Creatures that have wings belong to a category that we \nmight call \u2018winged creatures\u2019. Like members of the category \u2018bird\u2019, \nbutterflies are \u2018winged creatures\u2019. But are butterflies birds? We don\u2019t \ncount them as birds, because creatures belonging to the category \u2018bird\u2019 \nhave beaks; butterflies don\u2019t. Similarly, creatures in the category \u2018cat\u2019 \nhave retractable claws; those in the category \u2018dog\u2019 don\u2019t. \nSub-categorization has to do with categories within categories. For \ninstance, the sentence, \u201cHumans are mammals,\u201d expresses the idea that \nhumans are a sub-category of the category of mammals. The sentence, \n\u201cTriangles are polygons,\u201d expresses the idea that triangles are a sub-\ncategory of the category of polygons.  \n THINK & DO #4 \n  \nWhat are the categories and sub-categories in Figures 1 \u2013 4? \nWe often find situations in which X is a sub-category of Y, Y is a sub-\ncategory of Z, Z is a sub-category of M, and so on. In biology, this is \ncalled taxonomy. (The term \u2018taxon\u2019 means category.)  \nTaxonomies have a hierarchical (branching) structure, much like an \ninverted tree.

To make this concept useful in domains outside \nmathematics, we are going to extend the concept of a set as a collection \nof abstract mathematical objects to a collection of any objects. In \nastronomy, for instance, planets, stars, and galaxies are sets. In \nchemistry, hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, carbon atoms, water \nmolecules, and hydrogen molecules are sets. In biology, humans, \nchimpanzees, mammals, insects, and animals are sets. In literary \nstudies, poems, plays, novels, and short stories are sets. In statisics, \nsamples and populations are sets. Societies, communities, organisations, \ninstitutions, schools, colleges, hospitals, political parties, are all \nreligions are also sets.  \nA word about notation. In set theory, sets are enclosed in curly brackets. \nSo {A} means \u201cset A\u201d. {2, 5, 17} means \u201cthe set of 2, 5, and 17.\u201d  The \nsymbol \u2208 represents \u2018member(s) of a set\u2019. Thus, x \u2208 {A} means \u2018x is a \nmember of set A\u2019. And represents \u201csubset of a set;\u201d {A} \u2286 {B} means \u201cSet \nA is a subset of set B.\u201d \nThis might make you wonder: if such things as chimpanzees, mammals, \nand streets are sets, what is the difference between sets and categories?   \nAnd what is the difference between subsets and subcategories? \nThe answer is that categories are a special kind of sets.

In contrast, given: \n \n{carbon atoms}, {animals}, {even numbers}, and  {hospitals}, \neach of them is a set that is also a category.   \nAs for sub-categories, we have already seen the subcategory relation in \nbiology (humans, mammals, vertebrates, animals, \u2026) and in geometry \n(square, rectangle, parallelogram, quadrilateral, polygon) as examples.  \n6.2 Logical Inheritance \nAs we have seen in Sections 2 to 4, an important logical property of the \nthe subcategory relation, absent in the subset relation is, illustrated in \nthe following derivation: \nP1: Humans are Primates \nP2: Primates are mammals. \nP3: Mammals are vertebrates.  \nP4: Vertebrates are animals. \nP5: Animals have an alimentary canal. \nC: Therefore, humans have an alimentary canal.  \nWhile P1-P4 are premises that express the relation of subcategorization \nbetween two categories, P5 is a statement of a property that is \ndistinctive of the members of a category. What allows us to deduce the \nconclusion C is the following principle of logical inheritance:  \nLogical Inheritance  \nThe properties of the members of a category are inherited by the \nmembers of its subcategories.  \n6.3 Categories and Units \nRelated to the concepts of categories and subcategories is the concept of \nthe hierarchy of units and sub-units. Here are two examples: \nSubatomic particles > atoms > molecules > cells > organs > \norganisms > communities  \nWhile the term molecule refers to a unit, the terms water molecule, \nsodium chloride, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon molecule \nrefer to categories of molecules. While the term atom refers to a unit, the \nterms hydrogen atom, oxygen atom, and carbon atom refer to categories \nof units. While the term subatomic particle refers to a unit, the terms \nelectron, muon, and photon refer to categories of subatomic particles.  \nThe relation between units and their subunits, as well as between \ncategories and their subcategories, is that of compostionality.

The properties of crystals, for \ninstance, are not inherited by the molecules they are composed of. The \nproperties of molecules are not inherited by the atoms they are \ncomposed of.  \nThe absence of logical inheritance in the part-whole relation between \nunits and subunits allows for members of a unit to have properties that \nare not present in its subunits. The presence of such novel properties in \na unit is called emergence in the philosophy of science. \n7 What did you Learn in this Chapter?    \nWe hope that this chapter has helped you see that many of the terms we \nlearn in school and college express categories. Learning becomes easier \nif we understand that in academic knowledge, words like triangle, \npolygon, mammal, insect, male, female, science, etc. express categories. \nCategories allow us to discover Observational Generalisations about \ntheir members, e.g., Butterflies have compound eyes. Combined with \nthe principle of Logical Inheritance, the postulation of sub-category \nrelations allows us to arrive at conclusions on the members of their \nsubcategories.  \nThere are two important questions that came up in the conversations in \nthis chapter: \nQuestion 1: How do we choose between alternative ways of classifying a \nset of entities? \nThe answer is simple. We choose the classification from which we can \nmake the most number of inferences from the smallest number of \npremises. We used this criterion in choosing to classify squares as a sub-\ncategory of rectangles rather than as a separate category. \nQuestion 2: Given a term, how do we critically evaluate the concept it \nrefers to, in order to decide if it is a justified category in \nacademic knowledge?   \nWe judge a category to be justified if it allows us to make inferences. A \ncategory that allows us to make more useful inferences than others has \ngreater legitimacy. And if a category doesn\u2019t allow us to make useful \ninferences, it is arbitrary. \nThis difference can help us learn something important about how we \nrespond to the statements that we receive from others \u2014 books, the \ninternet, or other people \u2014 and accept as knowledge. Before accepting \nstatements, we need to subject them to careful scrutiny, and decide for \nourselves whether or not to accept them. This applies to our own \nconclusions as well"

He thought to himself: \n \nA generalisation is a statement about a population.   \nSo when a textbook says that all mammals have lungs, that statement \nis a generalisation because it is about the entire population of \nmammals, some of them currently existing, some of them already dead \nand gone, and some yet to be born.  \nWhat is a population? Well, it is clear that the members of any category \nare members of a population. But does every population constitute a \ncategory? All the living organisms in a city constitute the population of \nliving organisms in that city. But they may not form a category. Perhaps \nthe concept of a population is the same as the concept of a set, in that \nas in the case of the members of a set, it is not necessary that the \nmembers of a population have any shared properties.    \nRafa decided to focus on populations that are categories, like dogs, \nmammals, vertebrates, and animals.  \nThen it hit him that to formulate statements about such populations, it \nis not possible to examine every member of the population. For example, \nto check if all mammals have lungs, there is no way to examine ALL \nmammals, as that population would include all the mammals that are \ndead, and all the mammals that are yet to be born. So the basis for \nmaking the generalisation must be a sample of the population that we \nhave observed. When we observe a sample of mammals, we find that \nevery member in that sample has lungs. So that is a property of the \nsample, a pattern in the sample. It was now clear to Rafa that a \ngeneralisation is what we say about a population on the basis of what \nwe find in a sample.  \nHe was beginning to get excited. He stopped and got off his bicycle, took \nout his notebook from his bag, and wrote: \n \n Patterns are regularities we observe in a sample.  \n A sample of a population is a subset of the population. \n Some populations can be infinite, or at least very large. \n If a population is infinite, it is impossible to examine \nevery member of the population. \n If it is very large, it is impr"

But what \nis the process of arriving at that conclusion? And it dawned on him: the \nprocess is that of reasoning. Given the pattern we find in a finite \nsample, we use reasoning to arrive at a conclusion on the population, \nand that conclusion is what we call a generalisation.   \nRafa opened his notebook again and drew a diagram: \n \npattern found in a finite \n \nconclusion: \nsample of a population \nREASONING \ngeneralisation \n(large, or even infinite) \n \non the population \n \nHe looked at the diagram carefully, then put the notebook away in his \nbag, and was on his way home again.  \nAt home, as he put his bag down, he thought of the incident in the \ncanteen. What was Anu objecting to? Aha! When the man said that all \nAmericans are rude, his reasoning was flawed, because he was basing it \non an entirely insufficient sample to arrive at a conclusion on the \npopulation. \u201cTrust Anu to get upset!\u201d he thought. \nThe generalisation that all mammals have lungs was not like that. The \nreasoning there was not flawed. What is the difference between the two \narguments? What makes the reasoning in one of them good and in the \nother one bad?   \nAs he sat still on his bed, thinking, unable to come up with an answer, \nhe heard his mother calling him from the kitchen.

They asked him a \nbunch of questions to make sure they had all the details. Rafa, of \ncourse, was happy to respond.  \nWhen they were done, Neel had a question. \u201cYou know, the type of \ngeneralisation that we have been talking about has the form:  \n \n\u201cEvery member of category X has property P.\u201d  \nSo we said that every member of the category \u2018mammal\u2019 has the property \nof having lungs.

Did I get that \nright?\u201d  \nRafa: Yes, that\u2019s it.  \nNeel: But now you\u2019re saying that a category is a population.  \nRafa: Yes, that\u2019s what I am saying.  \nNeel: There is a question that\u2019s bothering me. In the case of lungs, and \nof intersecting straight lines, the properties don\u2019t vary. But what \nwould happen if there is variability in the sample? How do we \ngeneralise in such cases?  \nAnu: I don\u2019t get what you are saying. What do you have in mind? \nNeel: Okay. Take the example of human height. You\u2019ll agree that no \nadult human can be, say, less than one foot tall? And you\u2019ll also \nagree that no adult human can be, say, more than 10 feet tall? \nAnu: Right. \nNeel: What kind of generalisation can we make on the height of \nhumans? In our sample, one human may be five feet tall, another \nmay be five and a half feet tall, yet another may be six feet tall, \nand so on.

Human height varies, but only within a given range. \nBut what about generalisations within that range? If I told you \nthat Zeno is an adult human being, and asked you what his \nheight might be, you might say something like: \u201cMost likely \naround five and a half feet.\u201d Can he be seven feet tall?

I looked up human height in Wikipedia, and it says that the \naverage height of adult Indian males is around 166 cms, and the \naverage height of adult Indian females is around 152 cms.\u201d  \nRafa: Aha! That\u2019s it! So if someone tells us that Zeno is an adult male, \nwe can infer that his height is likely to be around 166 cms. That \nanswers Neel\u2019s question! \nNeel: Not so quick, Rafa, you\u2019re not thinking. Anu, you\u2019re right about \naverage height. But that\u2019s not enough.

And if we know that an organism has \ncompound eyes, we can infer it has six legs. So that must be a \ncorrelation. \nSocs: You\u2019re right, it is.  \nRafa: But there\u2019s no mathematical formula or theorem here. \nSocs: Correlations don\u2019t have to be mathematical.

Our \njudgment that such a generalisation is flawed led to an investigation of \nthe distinction between generalisations that we judge to be legitimate, \nand those that we judge to be illegitimate or unfounded.    \nThe journey that we shared with the main characters in our story in this \nchapter shows that generalisations are a central ingredient in \nmathematics, the physical-biological-human sciences, and human \naffairs in general, and even in matters of personal judgment.  \nIt would be useful to bear in mind that generalisations are of many \nkinds, not all of them illustrated in the dialogues in the chapter. They \nmay be about properties or relations (e.g., All birds have feathers, vs. If \na creature has lungs, it also has red blood.) They may also be about \neither quantitative or qualitative (e.g., a correlation: between a person\u2019s \nheight and weight (quantitative), vs. between having feathers and having \ntwo legs (qualitative).)  \nAs you must have gathered from Chapters 1-7, tools of inquiry such as \nclassifying, defining, and generalising are valuable for a deep and \nintegrated understanding of the structure of the knowledge that we are \nexposed to in school and college. Those who are interested in research \nwould also find that these tools serve as a valuable foundation for their \nexploration.  \n"

(See Ch. 7, Fig. 9). \nWe called this idea LOGICAL INHERITANCE  \n(Before proceeding further, it would be good for you to revisit the \ndiscussion of \u2018square as rectangle\u2019 in Ch. 7, Sections 3 and 4.)  \nTo see how this works, compare the following definitions of a \u2018square\u2019:  \n \nSquare: DEF. 1: A square is a closed figure made of exactly four \nstraight lines of equal length, with all four angles \nbeing right angles.  \n \nSquare: DEF. 2: A square is an equilateral rectangle. \nIn Chapter 7, we decided to treat a square as a rectangle, with good \nreasons. Def. 2 builds on this idea. This definition has two parts: \n \nA: a square is a rectangle. \nB: a square is equilateral. \n(A) is a statement about subcategorisation. If we specify a square as a \nsubcategory of rectangle, then by the principle of logical inheritance, all \nthe properties of rectangles are inherited by squares.

Neither of these are forms of \u2018evidence\u2019. \nHowever, the proof here is a form of justification. \n4.3 Argument \nAn argument involves a chain of reasoning that connects the grounds to \na conclusion. The extended reasoning that Zeno gives to justify his claim \n(that the dead man in the well was murdered) makes it an argument. The \njustification above (of the area of a square with sides a being greater than \nthe area of an equilateral triangle with sides a) is also an argument.  \nNOTE: The concept of argument described here is quite different from the \neveryday meaning of argument, as in: \u201cThey were arguing all night, their loud \nvoices disturbing their neighbours.\u201d Here, \u2018argue\u2019 is an expression of \ndisagreement, without necessarily presenting evidence and/or reasoning in \nsupport of the positions. This activity does not qualify as an argument in \nrational inquiry. \nAnother meaning of the term argument, popular in the humanities, is that of an \nextended elucidation of a claim, not necessarily supported by evidence and \nreasoning. In such cases, the statement: \u201cI argue that modernity is harmful,\u201d \nshould be interpreted as: \u201cI present the view, with details, that modernity is \nharmful.\u201d It is important to distinguish this meaning of \u2018argument\u2019 from the \nconcept of argument as evidence and/or reasoning in support of a conclusion. \nIn contrast to the murder argument and the area-of-square-and-triangle \nargument, Zeno\u2019s justification for the number of toes on his right foot, \nand for the volume of the statue, can be expressed simply by pointing to \nthe relevant evidence, without the need to express it as an argument.  \n4.4 Proof \nThe term proof can be used in a restrictive sense, to refer only to the \nkind of proofs that we find in mathematics.

How would you \ngather the relevant data/ information to prove/justify your claim?  \n To prove any of these claims, we need to (i) define development, (ii) set up clear \ncriteria to measure the different parameters of development, and (iii) find ways \nto arrive at an overall number that serves as the index of development. To do \nthis, you would need to think through different concepts of development.  \n If you ask someone, \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d and (s)he says \u201cI am a \ndeveloper,\u201d the concept of development implicit in the answer is that of real \nestate development or software development. For instance, according to \nWikipedia, \u201cDevelopers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have \nbuilders build projects, create, imagine, control and orchestrate the process of \ndevelopment from the beginning to end.\u201d \n Clearly, this is not the concept of development that governments seem to have. \nIn January 2014, for instance, Narendra Modi identified five core parameters \nof development: growth of industry; education, and skilled manpower; small-\nscale industries and health sector; value addition; and purchasing power. This \nappears to be the concept of the development of industry-economy in a \ncountry, where the purpose of education is primarily to serve the industry\u2019s \nneeds of skilled manpower.  \n A somewhat different conception of development is presented in the definition \nof development by the United Nations (http://goo.gl/0dWQxB).  \n Yet another concept is that of \u2018development as freedom,\u2019 proposed by Amartya \nSen in 1998 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_as_Freedom).  \n To prove your conclusion on development in India, you will have to make up \nyour mind about which of these (or some other) concepts of development you \nwould subscribe to. \n5 Justifying in Science, Mathematics, and Ethics  \nBefore we proceed, we should note that we use the words proof, \nargument, and justification to mean the same thing. They all refer to the \nprocess of giving reasons in support of a conclusion (or claim/position). \nThis is why, when we say \u2018justification\u2019, we mean \u2018rational justification\u2019. \n5.1 Justification in Scientific Inquiry \nRemember the disagreement between Neel"

The heart became \u201cdistended, turned \npurple to livid in colour,\u201d and looked as if it was about to \nburst. \n3  \nThe lungs \npurify blood \nand infuse it \nwith oxygen. \niv When you tie a bandage lightly around your arm (enough \nto constrict the veins but not the arteries), little points of \nswelling stand out at the valves in the veins below the \nbandage. \n4  \nArteries carry \nblood away \nfrom the heart. \nv \nWhen you tie a bandage very tightly around your arm \n(such that both the arteries and the veins are constricted), \nthe pulse on your wrist becomes weak, and there is a \nthrobbing between the bandage and the shoulder.  \n5  \nVeins carry \nblood to the \nheart.  \nvi When we have strong emotions, our heart starts beating \nfaster. \n \n \n \nHere are ten statements about the relation between the Observational Reports \n(ORs) and the Claims (Cs) given above.  \nWhich of these statements would you regard as legitimate?

Socrates was beginning to treat himself as Rafa\u2019s roommate, \nsleeping in Rafa\u2019s bed whenever he felt like. Rafa didn\u2019t like others \nsleeping in his bed. But he couldn\u2019t tell Socrates how he felt. How can \none be rude to someone who died so many centuries ago?   \nAs Rafa entered the room, Socrates opened his eyes.  \nSocs: Ah, my young friend, so you had a good discussion on the \ndistinction between assumption-based and observation-based \nproofs? \nRafa: We did, yes, but... how did you know? You were not there! \nSocs: You forget that I don\u2019t have to be somewhere in a physical form, \nbecause I\u2019m a disembodied mind, what some people call soul. \nRafa: But a mind cannot exist without a body, Socs.

But I don\u2019t need to have my own \nbody to exist, I can exist in your brain. \nRafa: Are you saying that you are a phantom in my brain? Am I \nhallucinating? \nSocs: Oh, no, I do exist independently of you. But for my physical \nexistence, I am dependent on your body, just like a parasite that \ndraws its sustenance from its host. And just as parasites and their \nhosts can benefit each other, I help you develop your intellect, and \nyou allow me to exist. And I must say, I am really grateful to you \nfor allowing me to exist. \nRafa: I\u2019m not sure what you mean. \nSocs: Okay, enough of that. Let us go back to what we were talking \nabout, the distinction between assumption-based and observation-\nbased proofs. \nRafa: What about them?  \nSocs: Ah, I\u2019m going to ask you a question.

For this, we used the \nstructure of Premises, Derivation, and Conclusion (PDC). We were also \nintroduced to logic as the study of reasoning, involving Rules of \nInference.  \nIn these chapters, we briefly explored causal reasoning as a specific form \nof reasoning. We saw how important it is to not confuse causation and \ncorrelation, when providing evidence and arguments or evaluating \nevidence and arguments in support of claims. Causal reasoning is a \nstaple form of reasoning used not only in the academic domain but also \nin our personal, professional and public life.   \nIn this chapter, we looked at different forms of rational justification, that \nwhich convinces us of the credibility of a proposition; the usefulness of a \nproduct; the effectiveness and efficiency of an action, or practice to \nachieve a given goal; or the value of something. \nWe began by distinguishing between two kinds of justification. One kind \nis based on data or information, and is typically found in the physical, \nbiological and human sciences. This is what we called observation-based \nproof. The second is justification based on axioms and definitions, found \nin mathematical and ethical inquiries. And we called this assumption-\nbased proof.  \nThere is a difference between assumption-based proofs on math and in \nethics. Rafa is still trying to figure out the difference. \n \n \nProof is an idol before whom the pure mathematician \ntortures himself.

Well, one answer is: \n\u201cWhen reading a piece of academic writing, we are expected to engage \nwith it critically.

However, that sceptical stance \u2014 a healthy distrust of \nauthority \u2014 is precisely what is needed when we read a research article. \nThat spirit of doubting and questioning is fundamental to the ethos of the \nrational temper, a characteristic of the academic culture, rooted in a deep \nawareness that human knowledge is uncertain and fallible.  \nSuch skepticism ought to extend to reading textbooks as well. Most of us \nare trained to read textbooks to acquire the information in them, and \napply it in examinations. Unfortunately, that mode of reading gets carried \nover to what one reads after graduation, and for those who go on to do \nresearch, when reading research literature as well.  \nIn what follows, we will talk about critical thinking as something that \nought to become a habit of our mind, and come naturally to us when we \nread textbooks and research articles.

The English words \u2018criticism\u2019 and \u2018criticise\u2019 have similar \nassociations of disapproval. When we say,\u201cAthena criticised Zeno's work,\u201d \nwe mean, \u201cAthena said something negative about Zeno's work.\u201d  \nThis is not what we mean by \u2018critical\u2019 in \u2018critical thinking\u2019.   \nThe meaning of the term \u2018criticism\u2019 in what is called \u2018literary criticism\u2019 \nand \u2018art criticism\u2019 refers typically to what scholars call literary analysis \nand interpretation, and art appreciation. This also applies to film \ncriticism. Thus, in the movie trilogy starting with Matrix, if we interpret \nthe hero (Neo) as a Jesus symbol, and give reasons for that \ninterpretation, that counts as film criticism.  \nAnalysis and interpretation by themselves are not what we mean by \n\u2018critical\u2019 in critical thinking and critical reading, even though they may be \na part of it. \nWhat DO we mean, then? An Internet search for the term \u2018critical \nthinking\u2019 yields many different definitions of the concept. In this book, we \nadopt and extend the definition given by philosopher-educationist John \nDewey, in his book, How We Think. He viewed critical thinking as \n\u201creflective thought,\u201d and defined it as:  \n\u201cactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form \nof knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the further \nconclusions to which it tends.\u201d (Dewey (1910): p. 6) \nDewey seems to restrict the concept of critical thinking to the context of \nbeliefs, that is, judging the credibility (believability) of propositions. We \nwill extend this concept to include the context of assessing the merit of \nany entity, action, or practice: credibility of propositions; effectiveness \nand efficiency of laws; ethical rightness of actions and practices; \nusefulness or beauty of things; and so on.

It is engaging critically \nwith what we read, going beyond mere reading comprehension. The \nconcepts of claim, justification, evidence, arguments, reasoning, \npremises, and conclusion are central to critical thinking as well as to \ncritical reading. \nThe activity of critical reading presupposes the capacity for reading \ncomprehension. To get a sense of what that means, take a look at: \n\u201cHow to Read Non-Fiction,\u201d at https://www.thinq.education/post/how-to-\nread-non-fiction. \nWe may define Critical Reading as follows: \nCritical reading is the process of applying critical thinking to what \none reads in order to arrive at an assessment of its merit. \nWhat we say about critical reading applies equally to critical listening: it \nis important to engage critically with what is written, or spoken. \nNow, the criteria we use to assess the \u2018merit\u2019 of a piece of spoken or \nwritten text would depend on the function of the text. We don\u2019t use \nidentical criteria to assess the merit of different kinds of writing. For \nexample, take the following pieces of text, all of which are on snakes: \n \ni) \nD H Lawrence's poem, \u201cSnake\u201d   \n \n \n(https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/148471/snake-\n5bec57d7bfa17)  \n \nii) \nthe Wikipedia entry, \u201cSnake,\u201d as a taxon in biology;  \n \n \n \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake) \n \niii) \na research article on snakes in a research journal; and \n \niv) \na class lecture on snakes. \nNor do we use identical criteria for assessing the merit of:  \nv) \nan autobiography \nvi) \nan advertisement,  \nvii) a newspaper report,  \nand so on. Each of these performs a different function, and hence their \ncritical evaluation calls for different sets of criteria.  \nWe won\u2019t take you through all these different types of texts in this \nintroduction to critical reading. We will deal only with texts that seek to \ncommunicate a body of propositions that claim to be collective \nknowledge.  \nAs an example, consider a prosecution lawyer making an argument for \nthe claim that the accused is guilty:  \n"

A glass of water can be divided into two half glasses of \nwater, and each of them can be further divided into two quarter glasses \nof water, and each of those into one eighths. Can this process of dividing \ngo on endlessly? \nThe Greek philosopher, Democritus (4th c. BCE), held that matter cannot \nbe divided and sub-divided infinitely; that the breaking up of matter \ncomes to an end when we get to the indivisible units of matter called \natomos. We find the same idea in Ancient Indian thought, attributed to a \nphilosopher called Kanaada.  \nIn contrast to Democritus and Kanaada, Aristotle (4th c. BCE), another \nGreek philosopher, held that any body of matter, however small, can be \ndivided and subdivided infinitely. According to him, this process never \nends. \nWe don\u2019t know if the idea of atomicity originated in Ancient India or in \nAncient Greece, but it was revived by John Dalton at the beginning of the \nnineteenth century, and is now the received wisdom in all school \ntextbooks. \nOnce again, it is important to ask why we should accept what the school \ntextbooks say, and reject what an ancient authority like Aristotle said. \nAnswering this question too would require a critical understanding of \ncertain concepts, in this case, the atomic and non-atomic conceptions of \nmatter.  \nWe can make similar remarks about the helio-centric (sun-centered) vs. \ngeo-centric (earth-centered) models of the solar system. Why should we \nbelieve that the earth revolves around the sun, though we experience the \nearth as stationary? Coming to the evolutionary theory in biology, why \nshould we believe that all life forms on the earth evolved from the same \nancestors? And in human history, why should we believe that the Stone \nAge preceded the Metal Age in all human cultures?   \nYou must have noticed that though this book aims at understanding, it is \nnot designed to give you information in any of the \u2018subjects\u2019 taught in a \ncollege or university.

There was a time when the authorities in the West said that \nblack people are inferior to the white people.

Imagine an \nadvanced course on research that aims to develop research abilities \nacross all university subjects, ranging from mathematics to the physical-\nbiological-and-human sciences, and the humanities. Suppose such a \ncourse is at level 5. Then what you have learnt from this book is at level \n1. So Rafa's question can be interpreted as a plea for books for higher \nlevels.  \nWhat we will do here is to point you to certain readings, videos, and \ncourses available on the Internet. Take a look at them, and they will lead \nyou to other readings and courses. Here we go:   \nFeynman: Adventures of a Curious Character \nFeynman: The Meaning of it all \nEinstein and Infeld: Evolution of Physics \nRobert Sapolsky: Biological Foundations of Human Behavior \nResources, courses, webinars, and videos at:  \n \nThinQ website:  \n(https://www.thinq.education/)   \n \nand the videos at the ThinQ channel on YouTube: \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(https://www.youtube.com/@ThinQ_ed)  \nWe wish you an exciting journey in developing your higher order \ncognition beyond what this course has empowered you with.  \n \n \n"

That is, we \ndo not dare to examine certain beliefs which could be easily \ncontradicted by experience, because we are afraid of \nupsetting \nour \nemotional \nbalance. \nThere \nmay \nbe \ncircumstances in which it is not unwise to cling to illusions, \nbut in science we need a very different attitude, the \ninductive attitude. This attitude aims at adapting our beliefs \nto our experience as efficiently as possible. It requires a \ncertain preference for what is matter of fact. It requires a \nready ascent from observations to generalizations, and a \nready descent from the highest generalizations to the most \nconcrete observations. It requires saying \"maybe\" and \n\"perhaps\" in a thousand different shades. It requires many \nother things, especially the following three.  \n \nFirst, \nwe should be ready to revise any one of our \nbeliefs. \n \nSecond, we should change when there is a compelling \nreason to change it. \n \nThird, \nwe should not change a belief wantonly, \nwithout some good reason.\u201d \nThe first point needs \u2018intellectual courage\u2019\u2026 The second \npoint needs \u2018intellectual honesty\u2019\u2026 The third point needs \n\u2018wise restraint\u2019. \n \nG Polya (1954:7-8)  \nMathematics and Plausible Reasoning \n"
